# Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Because of that, you should have Node (tested on v16.16.0), and yarn (tested on 1.22.19, or npm) installed on your device.

If the conditions are met, you can get the code going by running `yarn` on the working folder.

(*Note: if `yarn` doesn't work, you should check if something is wrong with the .lock file. Generally, it will be fine to delete the lockfiles and the node-modules folder first and then run `yarn install` to override the previous erroneous installation* )

After installation, run `yarn start`. You will see the code running on your browser on localhost:3000.
